    This is my second web application. For this project I have decided to build a 
    library storage app with some minor guidance from The Odin Project.
    I decided to develop this project because I have recently found
    an admiration for reading novels and self-help books. Hence, to 
    show appreciation for my new hobby I decided to go forward with
    building this app.
